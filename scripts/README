Here are useful scripts

1. generate_direct_problem.py ga_config.json
Use this script to generate config for direct problem corresponding to ga_config.json
after you get results of genetic algorithm.
It extracts information from table_* files.

2. plotCSV.py
This script plots columns over time column from *.csv file generated by direct problem.

3. plot.py
Use this script to plot:
  1. best organism's APs from the last generation dumped by GA
  2. GA input APs 
  3. GA convergence rate 
  
4. dump_AP.py 500.csv 1000.csv 2000.csv dir
Extract AP from direct problem's csv files and save it to dir.
We recommend to run model for at least 1000 seconds.
Additionally, check whether it is steady-state or not.
